# config of EfficientViT-M0

# size of features input to model
image_size: 640

# the down-sampling rate of the first EfficientViT Block passed in
patch_size: 16

# attention mode in each stages
stages_mode: ['window_attention', 'window_attention', 'window_attention']

# the input dim of each stage
embed_dims: [64, 128, 192]

# the dimension of K and Q in each stage
key_dims: [16, 16, 16]

# the number of EfficientViT to stack in each stage
# At the beginning, the number of stacks was small, mainly because the features learned by the model in shallow
# layers were low semantic, and excessive stacking would increase computational overhead
depths: [1, 2, 3]

# the number of head
num_heads: [4, 4, 4]

# when using window_attention locality, window_size param will work
window_sizes: [7, 7, 7]

# these kernels used in cascaded group attention(CGA), which used in Token Interation in order to capture
# local information detail
kernels: [5, 5, 5, 5]

# the structure of down-sampling, called EfficientViT Subsample, 2 means ratio of down-sampling
down_ops: ['sandwich', 2]

# the hidden ratio in FFN, which is less than other Transformer, such as Transformer, ViT, Swin, MobilViT, DETR, BiFormer...
hidden_ratios: [2, 2, 2]
